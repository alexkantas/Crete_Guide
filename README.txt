Crete Guide mobile app

The current project is a HTML-CSS3-JAVASCRIPT-JQUERY phone application. 

Jquery plugin Mobilize Today TouchSlider it used in this project.

It's possible to run in any mobille device with use of Apache Gordova Phonegap.

You can you run the app by open the index.html or index-alternative.html. The differences between these two is that index.html dont use URL with queries eg. 'info.list.html?name=Museums' so its compatible with browsers who dont support queries for local filles .

- If you want to go to previous menu tap the page's title
- If you have problem with touchslider use the buttons at the bottom of the page

Checked for proper running on :
* Windows phone device ( with phonegap)
* FirefoxOS simulator (manifest.webapp is for FirefoxOS apps)
* Desktop Browsers
